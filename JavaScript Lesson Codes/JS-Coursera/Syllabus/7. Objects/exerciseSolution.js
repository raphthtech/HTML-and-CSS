Step 1
Create a new empty array literal and assign it to the variable clothes.
var clothes = [];

Step 2
Add 5 of your favorite items of clothing as strings using the push() method.
var clothes = [];
clothes.push('gray t-shirt'); // 1st item of clothing
clothes.push('blue t-shirt'); // 2nd item of clothing
clothes.push('yellow t-shirt'); // 3rd item of clothing
clothes.push('slippers'); // 4th item of clothing
clothes.push('old jeans'); // 5th item of clothing

Step 3
Remove the fifth piece of clothing from the array using the pop() method.
var clothes = [];
clothes.push('gray t-shirt'); // 1st item of clothing
clothes.push('blue t-shirt'); // 2nd item of clothing
clothes.push('yellow t-shirt'); // 3rd item of clothing
clothes.push('slippers'); // 4th item of clothing
clothes.push('old jeans'); // 5th item of clothing
clothes.pop();

Step 4
Add a new piece of clothing using the push() method.
var clothes = [];
clothes.push('gray t-shirt'); // 1st item of clothing
clothes.push('blue t-shirt'); // 2nd item of clothing
clothes.push('yellow t-shirt'); // 3rd item of clothing
clothes.push('slippers'); // 4th item of clothing
clothes.push('old jeans'); // 5th item of clothing
clothes.pop();
clothes.push('green scarf');

Step 5
Use console.log to show the third item from the clothes array in the console.
var clothes = [];
clothes.push('gray t-shirt'); // 1st item of clothing
clothes.push('blue t-shirt'); // 2nd item of clothing
clothes.push('yellow t-shirt'); // 3rd item of clothing
clothes.push('slippers'); // 4th item of clothing
clothes.push('old jeans'); // 5th item of clothing
clothes.pop();
clothes.push('green scarf');
console.log(clothes[2]);

Step 6
Create a new empty object literal and assign it to the variable favCar.
var favCar = {};


Step 7
Using the dot notation, assign a color property to the favCar object and give it a string value with the color of your choice.
var favCar = {};
favCar.color = "red";

Step 8
Using the dot notation, assign a covertible property to the favCar object and give it a boolean value of your choice.
var favCar = {};
favCar.color = "red";
favCar.convertible = true;

Use the console to log the entire favCar object.
var favCar = {};
favCar.color = "red";
favCar.convertible = true;
console.log(favCar);
